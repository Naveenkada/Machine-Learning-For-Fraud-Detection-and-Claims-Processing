### Project Brief


# Project Title :  

# **Blockchain-Powered Fraud Detection and Claims Processing with Machine Learning in Insurance.**

### Project Introduction:

Insurance as a body deals with the financial aspect of the business by a factor of risk analysis and mitigation process. The insurer will always strive to have the immunity of its assets by factors of security and claims. This company make a profit of investing the insured assets earns profits from it before the risk insured against by the client is experienced. 

The insurance take (policy) lapse after a specific period out which the company would now have maximized its profits. Since this business is carried out in a digital ecosystem, the process is subjected to threats such as security, fraud and other cyber-attacks. Upon issue of the policy, the beneficiary has to wait for the policy to mature to claim the benefits. It is during the claim process that the fraud activities are introduced into the business and the company experiences losses out of it.

The process of critically assessing the claim process and evaluating whether it is fraud or not requires top-notch security to ensure the company does not undergo losses. Blockchain technology has proven to have an efficient distributed security with digital signatures that make such threats difficult to occur. This is the only way the forms can remain relevant and immune.



#### Project Objectives:

With the utilization of Blockchain technology and machine learning techniques for fraud detection, this project seeks to provide an efficient and reliable solution to not only the insurance firms but also the financial institutions. The project acknowledges data privacy as a principle and targets to source its dataset from the Kaggle repository. This by virtue is to follow the ethical project execution.
1. Enhance Fraud Detection Capabilities: The project aims to leverage blockchain technology and machine learning algorithms to improve the insurance industry's ability to detect and prevent fraudulent claims. By developing sophisticated fraud detection models, the project seeks to reduce financial losses for insurance companies and enhance trust in the ecosystem.
2. Streamline Claims Processing: The project seeks to streamline the insurance claims process by implementing smart contracts on the blockchain. By automating the claims process and ensuring transparency and accuracy, the project aims to expedite claims processing, leading to quicker payouts for policyholders and increased efficiency for insurers.
3. Enhance Data Privacy and Security: By utilizing blockchain technology's secure and transparent ledger, the project aims to enhance data privacy and security in the insurance industry. By implementing decentralized identity verification systems and securely storing customer data, the project aims to protect sensitive information from cyber threats and ensure the integrity of the insurance ecosystem.


### Project Questions :
1.	Can fraudulent transaction be predicted before they occur. 
2.	How cam machine learning approaches be employed to secure claim processes in insurances.
3.	To what extent can blockchain technology be considered secured for secured claim processes and financials in insurance?
4.	What are the best approaches to risk mitigation in financial sectors?
5.	What percentage gain can firms benefit monetarily from a secured claim process and risk analysis?
